# pipe
A very lightweight server-admin panel.

This is the Vagrant-repository for this project, configured for simple use on a Mac.

To get started:
- clone the repository.
- run 'vagrant up pipe' in the directory you cloned everything to.
- modify your /etc/hosts file to point pipe.dev to 192.168.33.10 (ref. Vagrantfile)
- open pipe.dev in your favorite browser to have a looksie.

If you're doing this on a Windows pc, you'll run into issues with virtualbox and private networking. 
Change to public, and set the IPs to match your subnet, and you'll probably be fine.
